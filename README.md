Welcome to my school project REST API!

This project was created as part of a server class and is intended for educational purposes only. It is a REST API that allows users to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on a list of students.

To use this API, I recommend using a program like Insomnia or Postman to send HTTP requests. Please note that the web interface for this API is not particularly stylish, as my focus was on the functionality of the API rather than the design of the web interface.

Thank you for visiting and I hope you find this project useful for learning about REST APIs.
